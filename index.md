title: Open Competency Framework Collaborative (OCF Collab)
layout: default
---
The <em>Open Competency Framework Collaborative Network</em> (OCF Collab) aims to make competency frameworks readily available to humans and machines by developing a membership trust network (Trust) of open registries holding one or more competency frameworks and by enabling search and retrieval of those frameworks and their competencies from any registry node in the network. The OCF Collab broadly defines the concept of a competency to include any attribute required to perform a work role including knowledge, skills, abilities, habits of mind or practice and tasks. The Collab defines a competency framework&mdash;Asset&mdash;as an instance of a logically related set of competencies based on a specific competency framework model that has been encoded using a recognized metamodel standard such as, but not limited to, IMS Global’s CASE, Credential Engine’s CTDL-ASN, and University of Washington’s ASN. Since the OCF Collab standard does not require a registry to natively use any particular metamodel, it relies on a transformation, or interchange service to transform instance data following one metamodel into instance data following a different metamodel.  In the T3 OCF Collab instance based on this specification, the transformation service used is Rosetta Lenssm by Eduworkstm. The mappings upon which such translation services rely are provided through the OCF Collab's [Data Ecosystem Schema Mapper](https://github.com/t3-innovation-network/desm/blob/master/README.md).

## Phase 1: Design network architecture and protocols. October 2019 through April 2020.

The draft specifications for the OCF Collab are the following. We recommend reading the "Getting STarted" guide first. The documents will remain a work in progress through the prototype period:

## Phase 2: Build a prototype of the Phase 1 design.

Prototype was finished and tested in December 2020. This activity was part of [The T3 Innovation Network Pilot Projects](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation/pilot-projects) Competency Data Collaborative Work Task 5.2.

## Phase 3: Pilot with new functionality.

Current development of the service is being handled through the <em>Open Competency Framework Collabortive</em> (OCF Collab) into early 2022 when the service will be taken to Web scale. The OCF Collab is a network under the umbrella of the [T3 Network of Networks](https://github.com/OCF-Collab/ocf-collab.github.io/blob/master/index.md).
