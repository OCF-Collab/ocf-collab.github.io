Competencies are understood both in industry and academia and can be applied in multiple contexts, making them a powerful unifying way to examine credentials. The Beta Credentials Framework has undergone extensive reviews and field testing in order to revise the framework and ensure its broad utility. An updated and full version of the framework is planned for a January 2019 release."
