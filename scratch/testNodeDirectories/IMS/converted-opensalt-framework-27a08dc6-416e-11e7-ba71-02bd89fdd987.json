Composed of DNA, genes are the chemical molecules containing the code that determine structure and function of all living organisms. Long before the structure of DNA was identified, Gregor Mendel was able to lay the foundation of the laws, patterns, and predictability that govern traits and their inheritance. From Mendel\u2019s work, with common garden peas, one of the first significant uses of this knowledge allowed mankind to improve the nature and quality of the food supply through selective breeding. Applications of Mendel\u2019s laws have led to a more comprehensive understanding of genetic disorders and their probability of being passed to successive generations.  It is undeniable that the practical results of Gregor Mendel\u2019s research have changed the way the world is viewed and mankind\u2019s place in it. Thus, the focus of this course is the recognition that Mendelian genetic laws form the framework of inheritance and that from the perspective of human genetics these constructs can be applied.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the molecular processes involving DNA and the basic laws of inheritance, this course teaches students that heredity is more than the random combinations of dominant and recessive characteristics. Genetics has become an ever-changing, fluid field of science. As knowledge is gained, the innovations and implications of gene manipulation are ever present. Over time, nature has evolved the mechanisms for variation and change within species, and now that process can be irrevocably altered through genetic engineering. An understanding of genetics in the modern world enables the student to better comprehend both the benefits and drawbacks of this new biological technology. \r\n\r\nFinally, students will consider the ethical challenges, which will inevitably arise, surrounding genetic manipulation. Genetic screening, designer drugs, DNA profiling and epigenetics are only a few of the issues students will experience, both directly and indirectly, in their lifetimes. Through this human genetics course, the student will be exposed to constructs like these and, as a result, gain insight into their scientific and social repercussions."]

The Project 2061\u2019s Benchmarks for Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts are used to make connections across different science disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs.\r\n\r\nScience consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly. Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be foremost in instruction.\r\n\r\nThis course will provide the student with an introduction to the concepts of modern astronomy, the origin and history of the Universe, and the formation of the Earth and the solar system. Students will compare the Earth's properties with those of the other planets and explore how the heavens have influenced human thought and action. The course gives a description of astronomical phenomena using the laws of physics. The course treats many standard topics including planets, stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies, and black holes.

In addition to classification and recognition, this course teaches students about the anatomical and physiological characteristics of animals. These characteristics relate to how an animal functions and can help students see the connections uniting particular animal groups. An understanding of form and function allows students to study how animals have evolved over time and to relate animals to their particular role in an ecosystem. Finally, students will develop an understanding that all living things are interconnected. Students should realize that the worldwide activities of humans can contribute to animal diversity both positively and negatively. It should also be understood that humans are dependent on animal species for advances in medicine, ecosystem maintenance, and food supply."]
