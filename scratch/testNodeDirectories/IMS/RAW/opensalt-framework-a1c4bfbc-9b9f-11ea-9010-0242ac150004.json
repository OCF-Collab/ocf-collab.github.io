The standards are intended to provide guidance while providing maximum flexibility for the users.\r\n\r\nThe National Standards for Quality Online Programs are broken into the following 14 standard categories:\r\n\r\n Standard A: Mission Statement\r\n\r\n Standard B: Governance\r\n\r\n Standard C: Leadership\r\n\r\n Standard D: Planning\r\n\r\n Standard E: Organizational Staff\r\n\r\n Standard F: Financial and Material Resources\r\n\r\n Standard G: Equity and Access\r\n\r\n Standard H: Integrity and Accountability\r\n\r\n Standard I: Curriculum and Course Design\r\n\r\n Standard J: Instruction\r\n\r\n Standard K: Assessment and Learner Performance\r\n\r\n Standard L: Faculty and Staff Support\r\n\r\n Standard M: Learner and Parent/Guardian Support\r\n\r\n Standard N: Program Evaluation\r\n\r\nEach standard is accompanied by a set of indicators. The standards team of contributors has expanded the guidance provided in previous versions of the standards by including explanations and examples. The explanations and examples will be particularly helpful for districts adopting the standards and indicators to fit their unique needs. Moreover, they will allow for a variety of program types, in addition to full-time virtual schools, to apply the standards to blended, competency-based, or other learning strategies being employed. By including explanations and examples, the standards revision teams have been mindful to balance the need for a usable set of benchmarks for quality online learning practices with the need for flexibility to accommodate the wide range of program types and available resources.\r\n\r\nThe National Standards for Quality Online Programs are identified on the following pages."},"CFItems":[{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/d30e3526-9b9f-11ea-bffd-0242ac150004","identifier":"d30e3526-9b9f-11ea-bffd-0242ac150004","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-05-21T20:29:31+00:00","CFItemType":"Standard","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Standard","identifier":"3de18277-9ce2-523b-a70d-e572220eab56","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/3de18277-9ce2-523b-a70d-e572220eab56"},"educationLevel":["OT"],"humanCodingScheme":"Standard A: Mission Statement","fullStatement":"A mission statement of a quality program clearly conveys its purpose and goals.
