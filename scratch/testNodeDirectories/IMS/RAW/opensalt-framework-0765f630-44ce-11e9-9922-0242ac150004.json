The instructional philosophies, approaches and models for online teaching are practically endless. The standards are intended to provide guidance while providing maximum flexibility for the users.\r\n\r\nThe National Standards for Quality Online Teaching are broken into the following eight standard categories:\r\n\r\n * Standard A: Professional Responsibilities\r\n * Standard B: Digital Pedagogy\r\n * Standard C: Community Building\r\n * Standard D: Learner Engagement\r\n * Standard E: Digital Citizenship\r\n * Standard F: Diverse Instruction\r\n * Standard G: Assessment and Measurement\r\n * Standard H: Instructional Design\r\n\r\nEach standard is accompanied by a set of indicators. The standards team of contributors has expanded the guidance provided in previous versions of the standards by including explanations and examples. The explanations and examples will be particularly helpful for districts adopting the standards and indicators to fit their unique needs. Moreover, they will allow for a variety of program types, in addition to full-time virtual schools, to apply the standards to blended, competency-based, or other learning strategies being employed. By including explanations and examples, the standards revision teams have been mindful to balance the need for a usable set of benchmarks for quality online learning practices with the need for flexibility to accommodate the wide range of programs types and available resources. In keeping with the unique needs of particular programs, it is recognized that not all standards and indicators may be appropriate. For example, some teachers in an online environment may have little or no ability to modify the curriculum or course content given to them, and therefore may not be able to demonstrate certain indicators.\r\n\r\nTeachers face different challenges in the online environment and the traditional classroom. The Online Teaching standards and indicators focus on online instruction that creates a highly individualized learning environment, and are not intended to address blended learning approaches and the use of technology in the traditional classroom. Classroom teachers would benefit from reviewing The Blended Learning Teacher Competency Framework."},"CFItems":[{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/a84b677e-44ce-11e9-91a1-0242ac150004","identifier":"a84b677e-44ce-11e9-91a1-0242ac150004","lastChangeDateTime":"2019-03-12T13:56:38+00:00","humanCodingScheme":"STANDARD
