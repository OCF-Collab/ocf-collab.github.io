For example, both the Aztec and Inca Empires were militarily defeated as the empire of Spain fought for control of the resources and labor in these areas.","language":"en","statusStartDate":"2019-07-05"},{"uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/97692f6c-6b9d-11ea-a8b5-0242c0a83003","identifier":"97692f6c-6b9d-11ea-a8b5-0242c0a83003","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-03-21T18:44:28+00:00","CFItemType":"Concepts and Practices","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Concepts and Practices","identifier":"3f639cdc-db1b-5b9a-aece-aeb0bdac0c51","uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/3f639cdc-db1b-5b9a-aece-aeb0bdac0c51"},"educationLevel":["07"],"fullStatement":"G: Human Environment Interaction","notes":"Human-environment interactions happen both in specific places and across broad regions.

Parliamentary and Presidential Democracies conceive of government authority as stemming from the consent of the governed and often operate in a cooperative way within the international sphere.","language":"en","statusStartDate":"2019-07-05"},{"uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/2eb1af9a-6d2c-11ea-89ce-0242c0a83003","identifier":"2eb1af9a-6d2c-11ea-89ce-0242c0a83003","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-05-19T15:06:22+00:00","CFItemType":"Standard","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Standard","identifier":"2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969","uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"humanCodingScheme":"HS.E.MA.1","fullStatement":"Evaluate how values and beliefs like economic freedom, equity, full employment, price stability, security, efficiency and growth help to form different types of economic systems.","notes":"**Disciplinary Clarification**: \r\n \r\nEconomic systems are created to address a country\u2019s cultural values, government processes, and the needs of citizens and are affected in that development by both resources and geography.

For example, monopolies for public utilities or oligopolies in industries (such as automobile manufacturing or oil and gas exploration) have high barriers to entry because a large amount of capital is needed to enter these markets. In emerging industries, like computer and internet technology, the barriers to entry are often much lower, as the internet, cloud computing and mobile phone access make it possible for entrepreneurs to access large markets with little capital investment. For example, traditional journalism and printing technology has a high barrier to entry, as writers must be hired, expensive printing equipment purchased and large distribution networks established. New internet-based communication forms have a lower barrier to entry, as a single writer can post and host their work at places such as low-cost blog sites and social media platforms.  Perfect competition is an ideal in which buyers and sellers are extremely numerous and well informed. Although perfect markets do not exist in the real world, the ideal can be used for comparison of markets as they actually operate. Monopolistic competition involves many producers, but their products are widely differentiated, meaning buyers cannot purchase an equivalent product or service from another vendor. Monopolistic competition generally has low barriers of entry. Oligopolies are markets with limited competition because there are only a small number of producers or sellers. A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.

In addition, economic ideas can influence political and society conditions within nations. For example, the rise of laissez-faire capitalism and the later rise of command economies in places like the USSR influenced politics and societies across the globe. The principles of free market capitalism and protection of private property spurred innovation and sharp increases in global wealth through trade and later through industrialization. The idea that free competition based on industry being attuned to the needs and desires of the consumer has produced a modern world which is far wealthier and healthier than in any previous era. In places like Singapore and Korea following WWII, laissez-faire economic policies allowed the transformation of weak and poor colonies into economically strong and innovative nation-states. Critiques of the inequalities produced by free markets led some to seek alternatives. In the case of command economies, the idea that bureaucrats can create less-volatile economic systems and more equal social conditions through top-down planning led to catastrophic failures. Some examples are the famine following China\u2019s Great Leap Forward of the 1950s or Cuba\u2019s revolutionary era of economic collapse and political repression following the takeover of their government in 1959 by Fidel Castro. In other cases, moderate levels of top-down planning and government guidance of the economy have been considered a successful alternative to fully laissez-faire economies. In some cases, free markets are combined with strong government protection, an idea which gained traction during the post-WWII era in places like Sweden, which have led to strong levels of social mobility as well as economic prosperity.","language":"en","statusStartDate":"2019-07-05"},{"uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/7ad4e9b6-6d2f-11ea-942b-0242c0a83003","identifier":"7ad4e9b6-6d2f-11ea-942b-0242c0a83003","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-05-19T15:09:40+00:00","CFItemType":"Standard","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Standard","identifier":"2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969","uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"humanCodingScheme":"HS.E.IC.3","fullStatement":"Perform a cost-benefit analysis on a real-world situation, using economic thinking to describe the marginal costs and benefits of a particular situation.","notes":"**Disciplinary Clarification**: \r\n\r\nAnalyzing the costs and benefits of various actions leads to informed economic decisions.

Each concept standard is outlined with a specific time period to limit the scope and sequence of the topics covered through that standard. Starting in the period 1300 through 1450, the Regional Transformation and Consolidation era develops many of the foundations of world history by requiring students to explore empires around the world and their early prominence on the world stage. The period 1450 through 1750, the Transregional and Global Interactions era, covers the global integration of ideas and movement by connecting major trends in world history like the Renaissance, Exploration and the Enlightenment. The next period, 1750 to 1900, covers the Political and Economics Revolutions era by developing many of the crucial concepts that lead to a need for more resources and the corresponding global competition. In the period 1900 to 1945, the standards cover Global Conflict through looking at the World Wars, other conflicts and how changes on the global scale attempted to prevent future conflicts. The final period, 1945 to the present, focuses on the Cold War, Decolonization and the Modern World while covering many of the changing cultural components of the present age. The standards are designed to develop students' knowledge of important social studies concepts (e.g., people, places, events, ideas and documents) and their use of disciplinary thinking skills in world history. By developing inquiry skills in history, students apply their conceptual knowledge through questioning, investigating, using evidence and communicating conclusions so they are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to be engaged citizens.\r\n\r\nWorld History\r\n\r\n1300 - 1450: \tRegional Transformation and Consolidation\r\n1450 - 1750: \tTransregional and Global Interactions\r\n1750 - 1900: \tPolitical and Economic Revolutions\r\n1900 - 1945: \tGlobal Conflict\r\n1945 - Present: \tCold War, Decolonization and the Modern World","language":"en","statusStartDate":"2019-07-05"},{"uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/16383706-6d34-11ea-912c-0242c0a83003","identifier":"16383706-6d34-11ea-912c-0242c0a83003","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-05-19T15:40:26+00:00","CFItemType":"Standard","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Standard","identifier":"2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969","uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"humanCodingScheme":"HS.WH.CO.5","fullStatement":"Analyze how advancements in communication, technology and trade impact global interactions from 1900-present.","notes":"**Disciplinary Clarification**:\r\n\r\nThe period began with advancements like the use of petroleum powered combustion engines on ships, the laying of the enhanced transatlantic telegraph cables and effective international financial organizations, and has evolved to include cheap and safe international air travel, the internet, cloud computing and global manufacturing systems.

With its cosmopolitan trading hub and political capital at Istanbul, it was well-placed to link the economic producers of luxury goods in Asia with the less advanced economies of Europe, which was a primary consumer of Asian luxuries in the period. This exchange of goods allowed tax revenue to flow into the Ottoman capital, which in turn fostered their military strength and conquests as well as their cultural achievements, for example, the building of the Blue Mosque.

Based on two rival alliance systems, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, both the First World and the Second World sought to establish their hegemony in the Third World through soft power like economic policies and aid, political sway and cultural influence. In addition to soft power, hard power was used to establish control as proxy wars were fought in places as varied as Korea, Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Angola. Among Third World Nations, an international Non-Aligned Movement was created by leaders like those of Ghana and Egypt, which tried to increase solidarity and cooperation among non-aligned nations. Other international organizations formed the basis of First World power, like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both created at the Bretton Woods Convention following WWII. Other organizations, like the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, promoted cooperation and de-escalation, with mixed results.","language":"en","statusStartDate":"2019-07-05"},{"uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/16380164-6d34-11ea-8159-0242c0a83003","identifier":"16380164-6d34-11ea-8159-0242c0a83003","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-05-19T15:40:05+00:00","CFItemType":"Standard","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Standard","identifier":"2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969","uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"humanCodingScheme":"HS.WH.CO.4","fullStatement":"Assess the effectiveness of institutions designed to foster collaboration, compromise and development from 1945-present.","notes":"**Disciplinary Clarification**:\r\n\r\nOther organizations, like the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, promoted cooperation and de-escalation, with mixed results.

Enlightenment thinkers questioned these traditional views, instead positing that humans were inherently possessed of rights and that they came together to form governments whose purpose was chiefly to protect these rights. Thus, only governments which derived their power from the consent of the governed were legitimate, meaning that popular sovereignty, not divine will, was the marker of good governance. Thus, people began to think of themselves as citizens, a person with rights and responsibilities within the state, rather than subjects, a person simply under the control and domination of a monarch. Revolutions in the British colonies of North America in 1776, in France after 1789 and in Latin America in the early 1800s were expressions of these ideas. The Haitian Revolution pushed these new views of human rights and government legitimacy even further as chattel slaves rebelled against their oppression, ended legal slavery and claimed the idea of natural rights for all people, rather than just a subset of people.

Targeting civilian populations became more common, especially after WWI because wars of attrition necessitated wearing down the combatant by stripping resources and personnel until one\u2019s rival was no longer capable of continuing the fight.","language":"en","statusStartDate":"2019-07-05"},{"uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/1640a648-6d34-11ea-bb8d-0242c0a83003","identifier":"1640a648-6d34-11ea-bb8d-0242c0a83003","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-05-19T15:33:27+00:00","CFItemType":"Standard","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Standard","identifier":"2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969","uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"humanCodingScheme":"HS.WH.CH.5","fullStatement":"Analyze how continuities in the desire for cheap labor led to slavery and other systems of forced labor across the globe between 1300-1888.","notes":"**Disciplinary Clarification**: \r\n\r\nEspecially before widespread industrialization, a variety of methods were used to extract labor from people for the purpose of production. Serfdom, in which labor was required of peasants who did not own land, but were tied to land owned by aristocratic landowners, was the norm across Europe in the feudal period and lasted in places like Russia until the Emancipation Edict of 1861. In the Inca Empire, extended family groups were required to pay labor taxes called mit\u2019a, during which they worked on things like large-scale infrastructure projects for the government. Within the Atlantic System, a new way of getting cheap labor, indentured servitude, resulted in an influx of poor European laborers to the Americas, driven by the hope of economic opportunity on one hand and the need for agricultural workers on the other. Indentured servitude was revived in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with East and South Asians migrating to sugar producing areas in the wake of chattel slavery\u2019s end. Domestic-work slaves were common across the Middle East throughout 1300-1900, and plantation-based chattel slavery spread from the Mediterranean to islands in the Atlantic and then to the western hemisphere after the discovery of the Americas as the market for luxury products like sugar and tobacco rose rapidly within the new Atlantic System of trade. Chattel slavery as an institution grew in size and scope throughout the period as laws like linking the status of a child to their enslaved mother were codified to ensure continued exploitation of that source of labor. The practice of chattel slavery of this type ended with the emancipation of slaves in Brazil in 1888. In these ways, unfree labor proliferated across the globe as global trade and economic interconnectedness rose. Force and coercion are hallmarks of all of these systems as fear and physical violence were used to extract labor.","language":"en","statusStartDate":"2019-07-05"},{"uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/16423bd4-6d34-11ea-91a5-0242c0a83003","identifier":"16423bd4-6d34-11ea-91a5-0242c0a83003","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-05-19T15:42:51+00:00","CFItemType":"Standard","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Standard","identifier":"2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969","uri":"https://casenetwork.imsglobal.org/uri/2d745335-aa67-4729-a42a-5cffd08b6969"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"humanCodingScheme":"HS.WH.CE.3","fullStatement":"Assess demographic, social and cultural consequences of forced migration and the expansion of plantation-based slavery into the Americas between 1500-1888.","notes":"**Disciplinary Clarification**:\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of the Americas into the emerging global market was driven by trade in raw materials. These valuable commodities, like silver and sugar, were extracted or grown only with labor-intensive processes. Thus, the desire for profits resulted in the creation and expansion of systems of unfree labor like encomienda among the indigenous population in areas colonized by Spain. Given by the monarch to colonists, grants of encomienda allowed landowners to extract labor without pay from populations living on that land. When this system did not provide enough labor to fill demand, forced migration took root. The violent system of chattel slavery emerged, as forced migration of West Africans across the Middle Passage from areas like modern-day Angola expanded dramatically. The emergence and spread of chattel slavery within the context of the Atlantic System of trade had devastating effects on both slaves, who were deprived of their lives and freedom, as well as on the demography and society of West Africa, which was depopulated and destabilized by the magnitude of the trade. Africans represented an important cultural and demographic strand within the emerging society being established in the Americas as people of African descent became the majority populations in places like Brazil and parts of the Caribbean. African religious and cultural traditions entered the hybrid culture of the Americas, which also contained contributions from both American Indians and Europeans.
