They begin to demonstrate their understanding of the organizational and basic features of print as they learn to track print and distinguish words from pictures and letters from words. Students should learn the basics of sound-print code and begin to develop comprehension strategies that will enable them to manipulate grade-level texts of appropriate complexity, including both story books and simple informational texts. Students will begin to connect their inquiries and responses directly to the text and identify main ideas. Kindergarten students will develop the ability to write letters and represent words with letters, identifying some high-frequency sight words and understandings of basic conventions of language. Kindergarteners will continue to increase the complexity of their spoken language and to use language in both one-on-one and group settings. While the kindergarten GSE makes clear specific expectations for reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language, these standards need not be a separate focus for instruction. Often, several standards can be addressed by a single, rich task."]

Fundamentally, students in grades K through five are focused on developing comprehension strategies that will enable them to manipulate grade-level texts of appropriate complexity and to communicate effectively both in writing and in speaking. Students will begin to anchor their inquiries and responses firmly to the text, whether literary or informational, using increasingly specific and relevant evidence to support their claims and inferences. Students\u2019 analytical skills will extend to identifying main idea/theme, understanding character and plot development, and evaluating the impact of word choice. Additionally, students will identify structural elements in text such as scenes and chapters, distinguish narrative voice, understand the impact of aesthetic elements, and make logical connections. A key component of the ELAGSE is the expectation of appropriate grade-level complexity in text choices. Complexity levels are assessed based upon a variety of indicators."]
