                    " Rodeman et al, 2006). Todd (2013) used a modified form of the Duncan et al (2009) LP with HS students to show that looking across levels (gene, protein, cell and trait levels had an impact). As Dreyfus and Jungwirth (1989) suggest, students will create ad hoc explanations for phenomena that are taught as processes that occur without a causal mechanism. So, it is important to tie the causal mechanism of proteins as the expression of genes at the molecular and trait level or students will create explanations as part of the normal sense making activities that occur when an explanation does not conform to prior understanding (Posner et al, 1988).  The primary focus here is on multicellular eukaryotes that engage in sexual reproduction so that the meiotic model is relevant and fewer exceptions (circular plasmid DNA) need to be addressed. Properties of prokaryotes and the peculiarities of their DNA can be handled in other units and progressions."

Knowing that decreasing the activation lowers the temperature needed to start a reaction (because more slowly moving particles can exceed the activation energy) can be used to explain why enzymes are so important. If a reaction would normally require a temperature of several hundred degrees to overcome the activation energy without a catalyst, that would mean that without an enzyme that a cell would need to be so hot that all the water would vaporize causing the cell to explode.
