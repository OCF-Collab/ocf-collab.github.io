In such societies, the question of what to produce is guided by the available resources. To this end, if there is a lot of land, the members of that society might depend on agriculture. If the abundant resource is water, then the society might depend largely on fishing. This is unlike the market system, in which there are many production choices as a result of targeted efforts by the members of the society to utilize different resources to increase the choice of goods and services that are available to consumers. The concept of the market emerged as empires expanded. For example, during the Song dynasty, the money supply increased based on trade routes.

A traditional economy is based on traditions and customs. Traditional economies produce products and services that are a direct result of their beliefs, customs, traditions and religions. In such societies, the question of what to produce is guided by the available resources. To this end, if there is a lot of land, the members of that society might depend on agriculture. If the abundant resource is water, then the society might depend largely on fishing. This is unlike the market system, in which there are many production choices as a result of targeted efforts by the members of the society to utilize different resources to increase the choice of goods and services that are available to consumers. The concept of the market emerged as empires expanded. For example, during the Song dynasty, the money supply increased based on trade routes. This led to moving away from traditional self-sufficiency to a reliance on a cash economy and interdependence."]

For example, monopolies for public utilities or oligopolies in industries (such as automobile manufacturing or oil and gas exploration) have high barriers to entry because a large amount of capital is needed to enter these markets. In emerging industries, like computer and internet technology, the barriers to entry are often much lower, as the internet, cloud computing and mobile phone access make it possible for entrepreneurs to access large markets with little capital investment. For example, traditional journalism and printing technology has a high barrier to entry, as writers must be hired, expensive printing equipment purchased and large distribution networks established. New internet-based communication forms have a lower barrier to entry, as a single writer can post and host their work at places such as low-cost blog sites and social media platforms.  Perfect competition is an ideal in which buyers and sellers are extremely numerous and well informed. Although perfect markets do not exist in the real world, the ideal can be used for comparison of markets as they actually operate. Monopolistic competition involves many producers, but their products are widely differentiated, meaning buyers cannot purchase an equivalent product or service from another vendor. Monopolistic competition generally has low barriers of entry. Oligopolies are markets with limited competition because there are only a small number of producers or sellers. A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity. The closer a market comes to the ideal of perfect competition, the better consumers\u2019 prices and access to quantity and variety in production become."]

As students study the United States\u2019 transition to a manufacturing economy and the movement of people, they are exposed to the conflicts and compromises within a diverse social and ethnic population that begin in 1890, through its role as a nation on the global stage in World War I. Beginning with the Great Depression of 1929, students further analyze the role of economic and political influences on what it means to be an American domestically and in World War II. Further conflicting ideologies, starting in 1945, challenge students to investigate competing viewpoints as demographics shift in America. As students continue their analysis of the collapse of the Cold War Order and Modern Challenges, students are encouraged to focus on the roles played by the United States in the modern world and their own place as a citizen within that context. By developing inquiry skills in history, students apply their conceptual knowledge through questioning, investigating, using evidence and communicating conclusions so they are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to be engaged citizens.\r\n\r\nUnited States History\r\n\r\n1877 - 1890: \tIndustrialization, Urbanization and Expansion\r\n1890 - 1929: \tCultural Shifts, U.S. Emergence as a Global Power and Growing Prosperity\r\n1929 - 1945: \tGreat Depression through World War II\r\n1945 - 1991: \tPost-War Prosperity, Cold War and Civil Rights\r\n1991 - Present: \tCollapse of the Cold War Order and Modern Challenges"]

In addition, economic ideas can influence political and society conditions within nations. For example, the rise of laissez-faire capitalism and the later rise of command economies in places like the USSR influenced politics and societies across the globe. The principles of free market capitalism and protection of private property spurred innovation and sharp increases in global wealth through trade and later through industrialization. The idea that free competition based on industry being attuned to the needs and desires of the consumer has produced a modern world which is far wealthier and healthier than in any previous era. In places like Singapore and Korea following WWII, laissez-faire economic policies allowed the transformation of weak and poor colonies into economically strong and innovative nation-states. Critiques of the inequalities produced by free markets led some to seek alternatives. In the case of command economies, the idea that bureaucrats can create less-volatile economic systems and more equal social conditions through top-down planning led to catastrophic failures. Some examples are the famine following China\u2019s Great Leap Forward of the 1950s or Cuba\u2019s revolutionary era of economic collapse and political repression following the takeover of their government in 1959 by Fidel Castro. In other cases, moderate levels of top-down planning and government guidance of the economy have been considered a successful alternative to fully laissez-faire economies. In some cases, free markets are combined with strong government protection, an idea which gained traction during the post-WWII era in places like Sweden, which have led to strong levels of social mobility as well as economic prosperity."]

Starting in the period 1300 through 1450, the Regional Transformation and Consolidation era develops many of the foundations of world history by requiring students to explore empires around the world and their early prominence on the world stage. The period 1450 through 1750, the Transregional and Global Interactions era, covers the global integration of ideas and movement by connecting major trends in world history like the Renaissance, Exploration and the Enlightenment. The next period, 1750 to 1900, covers the Political and Economics Revolutions era by developing many of the crucial concepts that lead to a need for more resources and the corresponding global competition. In the period 1900 to 1945, the standards cover Global Conflict through looking at the World Wars, other conflicts and how changes on the global scale attempted to prevent future conflicts. The final period, 1945 to the present, focuses on the Cold War, Decolonization and the Modern World while covering many of the changing cultural components of the present age. The standards are designed to develop students' knowledge of important social studies concepts (e.g., people, places, events, ideas and documents) and their use of disciplinary thinking skills in world history.

With its cosmopolitan trading hub and political capital at Istanbul, it was well-placed to link the economic producers of luxury goods in Asia with the less advanced economies of Europe, which was a primary consumer of Asian luxuries in the period. This exchange of goods allowed tax revenue to flow into the Ottoman capital, which in turn fostered their military strength and conquests as well as their cultural achievements, for example, the building of the Blue Mosque.

Thus, only governments which derived their power from the consent of the governed were legitimate, meaning that popular sovereignty, not divine will, was the marker of good governance. Thus, people began to think of themselves as citizens, a person with rights and responsibilities within the state, rather than subjects, a person simply under the control and domination of a monarch. Revolutions in the British colonies of North America in 1776, in France after 1789 and in Latin America in the early 1800s were expressions of these ideas. The Haitian Revolution pushed these new views of human rights and government legitimacy even further as chattel slaves rebelled against their oppression, ended legal slavery and claimed the idea of natural rights for all people, rather than just a subset of people.

Serfdom, in which labor was required of peasants who did not own land, but were tied to land owned by aristocratic landowners, was the norm across Europe in the feudal period and lasted in places like Russia until the Emancipation Edict of 1861. In the Inca Empire, extended family groups were required to pay labor taxes called mit\u2019a, during which they worked on things like large-scale infrastructure projects for the government. Within the Atlantic System, a new way of getting cheap labor, indentured servitude, resulted in an influx of poor European laborers to the Americas, driven by the hope of economic opportunity on one hand and the need for agricultural workers on the other. Indentured servitude was revived in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with East and South Asians migrating to sugar producing areas in the wake of chattel slavery\u2019s end. Domestic-work slaves were common across the Middle East throughout 1300-1900, and plantation-based chattel slavery spread from the Mediterranean to islands in the Atlantic and then to the western hemisphere after the discovery of the Americas as the market for luxury products like sugar and tobacco rose rapidly within the new Atlantic System of trade. Chattel slavery as an institution grew in size and scope throughout the period as laws like linking the status of a child to their enslaved mother were codified to ensure continued exploitation of that source of labor. The practice of chattel slavery of this type ended with the emancipation of slaves in Brazil in 1888. In these ways, unfree labor proliferated across the globe as global trade and economic interconnectedness rose. Force and coercion are hallmarks of all of these systems as fear and physical violence were used to extract labor."]

Given by the monarch to colonists, grants of encomienda allowed landowners to extract labor without pay from populations living on that land. When this system did not provide enough labor to fill demand, forced migration took root. The violent system of chattel slavery emerged, as forced migration of West Africans across the Middle Passage from areas like modern-day Angola expanded dramatically. The emergence and spread of chattel slavery within the context of the Atlantic System of trade had devastating effects on both slaves, who were deprived of their lives and freedom, as well as on the demography and society of West Africa, which was depopulated and destabilized by the magnitude of the trade. Africans represented an important cultural and demographic strand within the emerging society being established in the Americas as people of African descent became the majority populations in places like Brazil and parts of the Caribbean.

In places like the Americas, where disease wiped out huge portions of the already established populations, Europeans made deeper inroads, subjugating indigenous populations and creating empires on the foundations of previous governments, like the Aztec and Inca Empires, which were hybrid in character, combining aspects of the American, European and African populations which populated them."

Nationalism during WWI and hypernationalistic ideologies like National Socialism and fascism in WWII promoted the idea that some ethnicities and nations were superior to others and thus had a moral right to dominate others. Alliance Systems and secret agreements between nations also helped spark the beginning of WWI, the effects of which were so horrifying that politicians throughout the period leading to WWII relied on a policy of Appeasement to avoid another war. This reticence on the part of free market democracies, including the policy of isolation and noninterference by the United States, emboldened authoritarian governments like that of Germany, Italy and Japan to push their imperial boundaries and expand, ultimately leading to WWII, first in the Pacific and later in Europe and Africa. Economically, the traditional European powers were undermined as two new global powers with antagonistic world-views, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), emerged. Socially, the cost of total war led all members of nation-states to become necessary. As nation-states called upon citizens to take part in the war effort, citizens began to push nation-states to recognize and protect their rights. For example, the origin of the many aspects of the women\u2019s rights, labor and civil rights movements trace their roots to the role these citizens played in helping win WWII."]

Economically bolstered by the IMF and World Bank and politically backed by norms established by international groups like the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the global order is primarily based upon the ideological values of the United States and its democratic allies and is backed by U.S. military and economic power through organizations like NATO. During the Cold War, this order was challenged by the USSR, which sought to have its own ideology of Communism become the global norm. While these efforts ultimately failed following the collapse of the USSR in 1991, there are still challengers to this established order among both state and non-state actors. In foreign policy, powers like post-Cold War Russia seek to enhance their power and prestige by undermining American authority in places like Crimea and Syria while stirring dissention between democratic governments. Economically, newly powerful actors like China seek to expand their influence by tapping into the power their wealth and military hold. Both of these states are authoritarian in nature, posing a challenge to the United States and the democratic, free-trade ideals it seeks to promote. Among non-state actors are groups seeking greater social justice, who often use peaceful methods like boycotts, protests and social media awareness to promote their causes. Also included in non-state actors are fundamentalist groups like Islamic State, which seek to upend the norm of separation of church and state and instead create states founded on religious compulsion. Terrorist groups like these often use random violence in the hope that liberal democratic governments like the United States will become destabilized."]
