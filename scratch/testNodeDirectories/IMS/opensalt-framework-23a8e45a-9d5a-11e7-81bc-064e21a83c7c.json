three-course high school sequence specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.

three-course high school sequence specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.

standards in the three-course high school sequence specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.

Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including pre-calculus, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.

prepared to take higher\u2010level mathematics courses during their high school career, including Advanced Placement Calculus AB, Advanced Placement Calculus BC, and Advanced Placement Statistics. \r\n\r\nThe standards in the three-course high school sequence specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus. Standards for Mathematical Practice provide the foundation for instruction and assessment.","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/fc5ed0ec-9d60-11e7-ba71-57d581742683","identifier":"fc5ed0ec-9d60-11e7-ba71-57d581742683","lastChangeDateTime":"2018-08-30T15:55:59+00:00","CFItemType":"Domain","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Domain","identifier":"89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Seeing

specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.

Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including pre-calculus, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.

Concepts should be introduced and used, where appropriate, in the context of realistic phenomena.","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bba7a60e-9d61-11e7-a609-196713b7d622","identifier":"bba7a60e-9d61-11e7-a609-196713b7d622","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:18:58+00:00","CFItemType":"Cluster","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Cluster","identifier":"d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Students will explore the applications of ratios, proportions, and percents in financial situations.","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bba7802a-9d61-11e7-a98a-bea86164382a","identifier":"bba7802a-9d61-11e7-a98a-bea86164382a","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:18:47+00:00","CFItemType":"Domain","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Domain","identifier":"89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Number and Operations","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bba84f32-9d61-11e7-b85e-cd3809b5385a","identifier":"bba84f32-9d61-11e7-b85e-cd3809b5385a","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:22:21+00:00","CFItemType":"Cluster","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Cluster","identifier":"d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Students will explore the applications of functions, their characteristics, their use in modeling and matrices for solving problems in financial situations.","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bba82b2e-9d61-11e7-af05-883aabdd8bab","identifier":"bba82b2e-9d61-11e7-af05-883aabdd8bab","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:21:29+00:00","CFItemType":"Domain","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Domain","identifier":"89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Algebra","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bbaa1a2e-9d61-11e7-abda-a15a4a1ab4cf","identifier":"bbaa1a2e-9d61-11e7-abda-a15a4a1ab4cf","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:27:56+00:00","CFItemType":"Cluster","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Cluster","identifier":"d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Students will use geometry to explore real-world applications including, but not limited to, floor plans, square footage, models of furniture arrangements, trip planning, and accident investigations.","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bba9f6ac-9d61-11e7-b165-d41259a18ade","identifier":"bba9f6ac-9d61-11e7-b165-d41259a18ade","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:26:28+00:00","CFItemType":"Domain","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Domain","identifier":"89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Geometry","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bbaab894-9d61-11e7-9ade-7aadbfb50f86","identifier":"bbaab894-9d61-11e7-9ade-7aadbfb50f86","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:27:42+00:00","CFItemType":"Cluster","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Cluster","identifier":"d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/d77602ec-0098-5b60-b0c0-531cc61709e3"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Students will explore representations and models of data as tools in the decision making process of finance.","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/bbaa94e0-9d61-11e7-a29c-8b7b27377526","identifier":"bbaa94e0-9d61-11e7-a29c-8b7b27377526","lastChangeDateTime":"2017-12-07T16:27:33+00:00","CFItemType":"Domain","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Domain","identifier":"89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/89d67580-f024-5f77-abd7-acfaef39b204"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"fullStatement":"Data Analysis and Statistics","language":"en"},{"uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/c05607d6-9d61-11e7-814f-ca3082f44153","identifier":"c05607d6-9d61-11e7-814f-ca3082f44153","lastChangeDateTime":"2020-01-14T18:40:06+00:00","CFItemType":"Course","CFItemTypeURI":{"title":"Course","identifier":"ddf50a9c-aabe-11e8-bd40-3dcaf936fdaa","uri":"https://case.georgiastandards.org/uri/ddf50a9c-aabe-11e8-bd40-3dcaf936fdaa"},"educationLevel":["09","10","11","12"],"humanCodingScheme":"27.07700","fullStatement":"Multivariable Calculus","notes":"Multivariable Calculus is a fourth-year mathematics course option for students who have completed AP Calculus BC.

The course represents a discrete study of algebra with correlated statistics applications. \r\n\r\nThe standards in the three-course high school sequence specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and advanced courses including pre-calculus, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics of finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school mathematics content; a student\u2019s work with functions, for example, crosses a number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.
