			"en-us": "In collaboration with the Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (DOE EERE) and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS)/DOE Better Buildings Workforce Guidelines project, the Consortium for Building Energy Innovation (CBEI) team developed a competency model for the advanced commercial building (ACB) workforce that provides a support system to build a better workforce. The ACB workforce consists of the following job groups: Building Operations Professional, Energy Auditor, Building Commissioning Professional, and Energy Manager. This model was designed to address the needs of a high-growth sector, support the expansion of the advanced commercial buildings market and increased demand for a skilled and qualified workforce. This model is different from most of the models on the site as it was based off of job task analyses (JTA) for all four jobs. The knowledge and skills from the JTAs were analyzed and categorized to show shared competencies across all four jobs (Tiers 1-5) as well as unique competencies to each occupation (Tier 6-Occupation-Specific). Another unique characteristic of the ACB Competency Model is the inclusion of key performance competencies, which are identified by the asterisk (*) in the top tier (Occupation-Specific). These competencies are referenced as keys to success and focus on successful behaviors as opposed to the knowledge skills and abilities (KSAs) required to do the job. In 2018, the model was revised to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces."
