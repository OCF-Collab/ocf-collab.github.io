			"en-us": "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has worked with the Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) and technical and subject matter experts from education, business, and industry to update a comprehensive competency model for the Information Technology (IT) industry. While the model identifies the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for workers to perform successfully in the field of IT, it is not intended that IT workers possess all of the competencies listed. The model is rather a compilation of competencies that can be included as a basis for preparation in an IT occupation. The National Convergence Technology Center (CTC), Broadening Advanced Technological Education Connections (BATEC), the National Center for Information and Communications Technology (ITC), the Mid-Pacific Information and Communication Technologies Center (MPICT), California Community Colleges Information and Communication Technologies Collaborative (ICT), and CompTIA provided input and will ensure that the model evolves to accommodate changing skill requirements."
