			"en-us": "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) collaborated with technical and subject matter experts from education, business, and industry to develop a comprehensive competency model for the Enterprise Security Industry. The model is designed as a resource supporting workforce development efforts to prepare the security workers that fulfill critical roles in the protection of national and global economies, providing a multitude of career opportunities ranging from managers and directors of enterprise security to intelligence analysts and chief security officers with major multinational corporations.\n\nThe Apollo Education Group and University of Phoenix developed the model and validated it in partnership with the ASIS Foundation. The ASIS International Chief Security Officer (CSO) Roundtable Leadership and Development Committee provided input and conducted with Apollo Education Group and the ASIS Foundation a series of validation sessions that included international delegates, subject matter experts and sessions with Bridge School of Management in New Delhi, India. The ASIS Foundation will continue to ensure that the model evolves to accommodate changing skill requirements."
