			"en-us": "The Automation Competency Model framework was developed through a collaborative effort involving the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and industry experts from the Automation Federation.\n\nIn July 2018, the Automation Federation convened subject matter experts and worked with ETA to update the model to reflect the most current knowledge and skills needed by today's automation professionals. The update contains a realignment of skills and knowledge requirements including automation dynamics, latest industry standards, and updates to reflect performance management and decision support for industrial automation and control systems.\n\nThe revisions also incorporate foundational health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program, an initiative designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces. The updated CMC competencies were reviewed and validated by subject matter experts identified by the Automation Federation."
