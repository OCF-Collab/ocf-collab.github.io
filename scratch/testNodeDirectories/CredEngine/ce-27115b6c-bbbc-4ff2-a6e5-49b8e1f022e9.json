			"en-us": "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has worked with the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES) and other technical and subject matter experts from education, government, business, and industry, to develop a comprehensive competency model for Engineering. The model is designed as a resource that provides a lifelong learning template of the core competencies and skills necessary for entry into the engineering profession as well as for maintaining proficiency during one's career. AAES is comprised of many member organizations and it is through these working groups and other SMEs that the competency model was developed. They provided critical input on the profession's skill requirements and will continue to work with the model's industry champions to ensure that the model evolves to accommodate changing skill requirements.\n\nIn 2017, the model was revised to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces. The updated CMC competencies were reviewed and validated by subject matter experts identified by the AAES."
