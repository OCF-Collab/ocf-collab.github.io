			"en-us": "In 2009, the American Water Works Association (AWWA) worked with its membership to identify the specific competencies required for workers in the water and wastewater industry. In collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water and the Water Environment Federation (WEF), the results of those efforts were translated into the competency model framework provided by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) to create the first version of the model. In 2015, these organizations reconvened to begin the process of updating the model. Developed as a collaborative effort with subject matter experts from partnering organizations, the updated model was finalized in March 2016.\n\nIn 2017, the model was revised again to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces. The updated CMC competencies were reviewed and validated by subject matter experts from AWWA."
