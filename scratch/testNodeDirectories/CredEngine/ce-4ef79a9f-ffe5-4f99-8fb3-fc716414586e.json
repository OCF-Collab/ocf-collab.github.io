			"en-us": "The competency model framework for energy generation, transmission, and distribution was developed through a collaborative effort involving the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD).\n\nTo ensure that the model reflects the knowledge and skills needed by today's energy workforce, CEWD has taken the lead to update the model. The updated model contains new information on the need for Science and Information Technology skills and the importance of Ethics, Employability, and Entrepreneurship skills, as well as updated key behaviors in several competency areas.\n\nIn 2018, the model was revised again to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces."
