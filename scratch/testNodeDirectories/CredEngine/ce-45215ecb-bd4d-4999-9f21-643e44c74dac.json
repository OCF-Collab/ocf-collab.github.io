			"en-us": "In collaboration with the Bioscience Community of Practice, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has worked with education, business, and industry leaders to develop a comprehensive competency model for bioscience. The model is designed to evolve along with changing skill requirements. The community of practice members have committed to working with industry partners to keep the model current.\n\nThe study \"Technology, Talent and Capital: State Bioscience Initiatives 2008\" defines the biosciences as a diverse group of industries and activities with a common link—they apply knowledge of the way in which plants, animals, and humans function. The sector spans different markets and includes manufacturing, services, and research activities. By definition, the biosciences are a unique industry cluster and are constantly changing to incorporate the latest research and scientific discoveries."
