The model is designed to evolve along with changing skill requirements. AIA and NDIA have committed to working with their industry partners to keep the model current.\n\nIn 2018, the model was revised to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces."
