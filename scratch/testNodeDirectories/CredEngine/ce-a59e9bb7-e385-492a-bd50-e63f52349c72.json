			"en-us": "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has worked with technical and subject matter experts from education, business, and industry to develop a comprehensive competency model for the long-term care, supports, and services industry. The model is designed as a resource supporting workforce development efforts to prepare the workers who make it possible for the aging population and those with disabilities to live their lives with independence and dignity. The American Health Care Association (AHCA), the Paraprofessionals Healthcare Institute (PHI), the College of Direct Support, National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL), American Network of Community Options and Resources (ANCOR), Institute for the Future of Aging Services, the University of Minnesota Institute on Community Integration, and the University of Alaska, Anchorage Center for Human Development, and the National Alliance for Direct Support Professionals (NADSP) provided input and will continue to ensure that the model evolves to accommodate changing skill requirements.\n\nIn 2018, the model was revised to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces."
