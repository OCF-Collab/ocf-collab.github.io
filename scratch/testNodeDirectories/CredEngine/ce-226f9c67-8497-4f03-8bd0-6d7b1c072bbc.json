			"en-us": "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) worked with technical and subject matter experts from the Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL), and several industry associations to develop a competency model for renewable energy. The model supports workforce preparation for jobs in energy technologies that strengthen the economy, protect the environment, and diversify the U.S. energy system. The model is designed to evolve along with changing skill requirements.\n\nIn 2017, the model was revised to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces."
