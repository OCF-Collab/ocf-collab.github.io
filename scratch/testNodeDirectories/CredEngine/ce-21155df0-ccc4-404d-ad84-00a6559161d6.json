			"en-us": "In 2011, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) worked with technical and subject matter experts from education, business, and industry to develop a comprehensive competency model for the Electronic Health Records (EHR) industry sector. The model was designed as a resource supporting workforce development efforts to prepare the U.S. healthcare system to support quality healthcare outcomes through effective use of information technologies.\n\nIn 2017, ETA reconvened these subject matter experts to begin the process up updating the model. The model was finalized in late 2018. To reflect the evolving changes in the industry, the name has been changed to the Health Information Management Competency Model."
