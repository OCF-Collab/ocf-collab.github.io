			"en-us": "In 2012, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) worked with the Health Professionals Network (HPN) and other technical and subject matter experts from education, business, and industry to develop a comprehensive competency model for the allied health sector. The model is a compilation of competencies that can be included as a basis for preparation in the field of allied health. In 2015, HPN and its members reconvened to begin the process of updating the model. Developed as a collaborative effort with subject matter experts from partnering organizations, the updated model was finalized in April 2016. To reflect evolving changes in the industry, the name has been changed to the Fundamentals of Health Care Competency Model.\n\nIn 2018, the model was revised to incorporate foundational workplace health and safety skills from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program designed to help protect America's workforce and create safe, healthy, and productive workplaces."
