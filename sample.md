title: Sample Page
layout: default
---
This is a sample page showing how to add content to the site.

## YAML Metadata

The page should start with metadata in YAML format. The metadata is preceded by a line with three hyphens and concluded with another line in the same form. It must have `title` and `layout` attributes. The only layout presently defined is `default`. Other metadata such as `date` is optional.

## Body

The body is in markdown format.

## HTML pages

You can also put in straight HTML pages. Again, they should have YAML metadata at the beginning of the file. If the `default` layout is used, the HTML should only include the content of the page.
